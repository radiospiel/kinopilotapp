Thanks for participating in the Kinopilot beta test. These are the rules:

#0: feel free to disobey!

A note beforehand: Any application should just "make sense". So let your imagination run wild: click whereever you want to click, do whatever - this app should not crash. If it does, it is a bug, and I would like to hear about it. If you are at any point surprised at what you see: tell me, too - probably the UI flow could be improved then.

And if you don't feel like doing anything: hey, that is up to you. Thanks for at least considering it, and enjoy the kinopilot application.

#1: Installation hint

To install the kinopilot application just drag both the mobile provision file (.mobileprovision) and the application package into iTunes, and then sync your device. 

There is no way to find out in iTunes whether there is a mobile provision file, but your iDevice tells you this in Settings/General/Profiles. You should see something called "Kinopilot Mobile." Make sure it is the device that you sent me the UDID for. (Reminder: use UDIDit http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/udidit/id326123820?mt=8 to see and send the UDID)

If this process doesn't work for you let me know. 

#2: how to test the application

I am assuming that you like to go to the movies. Just imagine you would be a casual theatre lover: how would you want to use an application like this? At home, at work, in the U-bahn? Just try it, click around, and tell me your experience with it.

What is really hard to test for me is how kinopilot behaves when one moves around, and how it behaves in low/no network situations. Remember: it should not crash, it should not block, it should make sense.

#3: what I would especially like to hear about

If you find bugs or see room for improvement just tell me. Note that this version is more or less feature complete. Regardless of that you should tell me if you find a feature missing from the app.

What you should include:
- your iOS version (4 or 5, mainly)
- your device (iPhone, iPod, iPad)
- what do you feel is wrong in the app
- did you have wifi or 3G when you encountered the bug?
- did you enable location services when you installed the app?
- did you enable notifications when you installed the app?
- what did you do to see the bug
- can you reproduce the error?
- when did the app update for the last time (you see this in the app settings: click on the popcorn on the bottom left of the start page)
- is this update older than, say, 24 hrs from when the error appeared?
- how annoyed you are
- assuming you had the app installed: are you so annoyed that you would stop using it?

I can do with incomplete reports, too. The more complete a report is the more helpful it will be, though. 

FYI: 

Everything that stops the app from being useful at all I consider level 1 bugs, and will be fixed Level 1 bugs before publishing the software.

- If the application crashes
- if the application becomes unresponsive
- If there are wrong play times for movies, 
- clicks that would bring you somewhere don't work or end up in a different target.

Everything that stops the app from being useful in some aspects and/or only sometimes I consider level 2 bugs, and will hopefully be fixed soon, but won't hold me from publishing the software.

#4: when twittering

or so: sure, just go ahead. A few things to remember:
 
- this will be the app's homepage: http://kinopilotapp.de/p/kinopilot
- the hash tag would be #kinopilot

#5: feel free to disobey these rules!

This goes without sayingâ€¦ Have fun!



 


#1a: Some iOS hints

You probably will know this already, but just in case:


a) if you feel like reinstalling the app, you must remove it from the device. Tap the app icon on the home screen for a few seconds, and when it starts to wobble press the (X). After that sync your device with iTunes again. Reinstalling starts the application with a "clean sheet".

b) to "kill" the running up - because it hangs or for whatever other reason - you press the home button to see the home screen, then double tap the home button to see the list of "running" apps, then tap the kinopilot icon in there and wait until it wobbles then click the "x". The next time you start the app it runs from the start screen again.
